  content: `As a passionate tech enthusiast, I have dedicated the past two years to learning and honing my skills in frontend development. My focus has been on utilizing technologies such as React.js, Next.js, and TypeScript, which have played a crucial role in the projects I have undertaken.

  My journey into coding began during my electrical engineering graduation, where I discovered the power of programming languages in solving mathematical problems using tools like MATLAB and Python.

  During the final year of my graduation, I had the opportunity to work as an intern for a multinational company's CAPEX engineering team. This role involved implementing significant projects within the company. It was an invaluable experience that allowed me to actively participate in all stages of a project, from its conceptualization to its successful initiation.

  Subsequently, I worked as a project engineer assistant for a company specializing in industrial projects. During this time, I diligently followed established schedules while actively contributing to the development and execution of various projects. This experience further honed my ability to collaborate effectively with different teams from diverse areas, ensuring the successful completion of each project.
